## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-23

**stitchgraph goes polyglot.** The headline: a config-driven tree-sitter
extractor adds **11 more languages** alongside Python, all in one graph — so
dead-code, orientation, impact, and full-stack tracing now work across a
multi-language codebase.

### Added

- **Polyglot extraction (tree-sitter).** JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, Rust, C,
  C++, C#, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, and Bash — definitions (functions / methods /
  classes / structs / traits) and the call graph, in the same node/edge ontology
  as the Python `ast` extractor.
- **Config-driven languages.** Each language is a small `LangSpec` (node types →
  kinds, the call node + callee field). Adding a language is a spec, not new code.
- **Per-language resolution.** A JS call never binds to a Rust function of the
  same name; precision-biased (single match → confident, several → AMBIGUOUS to
  all, unknown → dropped as external).
- **Per-language entry-point roles.** `export` (JS/TS), `pub` (Rust), `public`
  (Java/PHP/C#), capitalised (Go), and `main` seed reachability.
- **Polyglot dispatcher.** `extract_project` merges Python + tree-sitter into one
  graph; a parse error in one language never breaks another.
- **[`docs/LANGUAGES.md`](docs/LANGUAGES.md)** — a language progress / support
  matrix (defs · calls · imports · inheritance · entry points per language).
- Packaging extras reorganised: `treesitter`, `precise` (jedi), `resolve`
  (sqlglot), `algebra` (graphblas), `all`.

### Notes / honest limits

- For the tree-sitter languages, **imports and inheritance aren't modelled yet**
  (calls still resolve cross-file by name, so dead-code/orient/trace work), and
  **entry-point detection is thin** (export/pub/public/capitalised/main) — so
  `find_stale` leans on `stitchgraph.toml` roots or honestly refuses without them.
- The hard part of any language is *type-correct* resolution (which `save` does
  `x.save()` mean?), not parsing — that's the deferred LSP upgrade.

### Tests

58 tests (up from 53), including a polyglot suite covering JS/Rust/Bash/Go/Java/
Ruby/PHP extraction, per-language call graphs, cross-language dead code, and the
no-cross-language-false-links guarantee.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-23

First tagged release. A local-first, MCP-native code-intelligence graph for
Python that finds **stale code, implementation holes, orientation, and impact** —
ranked by what's actually live, every answer carrying a confidence and a reason
to double-check. One core library, three thin surfaces (library API, CLI, MCP),
plus a Markdown report. **Read-only on your code — it never edits source.**

### Highlights

- **One graph, three surfaces.** A single operation registry is the Python
  library API; the Typer CLI and the FastMCP server are generated from it, so
  they map 1:1 by construction. Optional deps are lazy-imported (core is
  stdlib-only).
- **The refuse-when-unsure envelope.** Every result carries
  `confidence / provenance / needs_review / urgency`. Confidence is load-bearing:
  it gates review and propagates through the path algebra; provenance caps the
  urgency ceiling so nothing low-confidence shouts red.
- **Dead code & its dual, holes.** `find_stale` (unreachable from entry points)
  and `find_holes` (references with no target) — advisory, never asserted.
- **Full-stack cross-language tracing** — the "gem": HTML form → route → handler
  → … → DB table/column in one `trace_path`, confidence propagated.
- **GraphBLAS algebra** for whole-graph sweeps (reachability, transitive fan-in,
  PageRank) with a pure-Python fallback that the two agree on by test.
- **Git-risk fusion, runtime-trace fusion, semantic retrieval, data loops** —
  see operations below.

### Operations (14)

`find_symbol`, `get_callers`, `get_callees`, `orient`, `find_stale`,
`find_holes`, `impact_of`, `trace_path`, `scan` (ranked issues + urgency),
`reindex` (`--precise` for jedi), `get_matrix` (bounded submatrix), `risk`
(git churn × centrality + hidden coupling), `ingest_trace` (coverage fusion),
`find_similar` (token retrieval). Plus `stitchgraph report` and `AGENTS.md`
agent rules.

### Languages & frameworks

- **Fully analysed:** Python 3.11+ (stdlib `ast`; optional `jedi`).
- **Detected at the cross-language boundary:** web routes (Flask/FastAPI/
  blueprints), HTML templates (`<form action>`), SQL (via sqlglot), ORM
  (SQLAlchemy/Django). See [`docs/LANGUAGES.md`](docs/LANGUAGES.md).

### Configuration

`stitchgraph.toml`: entry-point overrides (the trust escape hatch), index ignore
globs, review threshold, hub metric. See `stitchgraph.toml.example`.

### Quality

53 tests, including a precision/recall eval harness that asserts the
precision-over-recall stance (never flag live code as dead). Dogfoods on its own
~235-node source: clean scan, holes 0, and a short list of genuine dead-code
candidates — all `needs_review`.

### Known limitations (honest)

- `find_stale` is `needs_review` at 0.6 (0.78 with a runtime trace): resolution
  is name/scope-based, not type-grade. `--precise` (jedi) and a future LSP raise
  this.
- Framework callbacks overriding an *external* base class (e.g. an `HTMLParser`
  method) can look uncalled — the remaining stale false-positive class.
- Python-only first-class analysis for now; JS/TS/Java and a tree-sitter/LSP
  backend are the next step.
